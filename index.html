                                    overwhelming, it can disrupt daily life. Learning practical tools can help regain
                                    control. Techniques like grounding exercises, diaphragmatic breathing, and cognitive
                                    reframing are powerful resources that can interrupt panic cycles. These coping
                                    mechanisms, often taught in therapy, are simple yet effective ways to manage
                                    symptoms in the moment and build long-term emotional resilience.</p>
